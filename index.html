                <p>
                    Athletes have definitely improved over the years. They are fitter, follow strict nutitional guidelines,
                    and have access to better resources than athletes of the past. <br /><br />

                    However, the role of technology in this improvement is often forgotten. Technology in sports is not limited to
                    electronic scoreboards or cameras to record every detail. Material technology and sports equipment have developed
                    significantly over the years and have helped athletes improve. <br /><br />

                    This visualization will discuss improvements in golf, swimming, and running. <br /><br />

                <h3>Graphite Shafts, 1995</h3>
                <p>
                The graphite shaft was first marketed in 1970 at the PGA Merchandise Show but did not gain widespread use until the mid-1990s and is now used on
                almost all woods and some iron sets, as the carbon-fiber composite of graphite shafts boasts increased flex for greater clubhead speed at the cost
                of slightly reduced accuracy due to greater torque. <br /><br />

                Bottom line, it increased the distance, everything else being the same, by about 7 or 8 yards.

                <h3>Titleist Pro V1, 2000</h3>
                <p>
                In 2000, golf equipment manufacturer Titleist released their solid core ball, the Titleist Pro V1. Because of the solid core, the ball was accurate
                and could be hit for long distances. <br /><br />

                Many professionals switched from wound core to solid core soon, resulting in a 6 yard increase in drive distance
                between 2000 and 2001. Subsequent generations of the Pro V1 would also greately affect the drive distance.

                <h3>Hybrid Clubs, 2002</h3>
                <p>
                TaylorMade made the hybrid club popular with the release of its first set of hybrids in 2002. A hybrid golf club is simply a golf club which is designed
                to be an easier to hit alternative to a long iron. <br /><br />

                The primary advantage of a hybrid club is that it has design characteristics that make it easier to hit
                the ball higher. In addition, a hybrid club on average will send a ball approximately 5 to 8 yards further than will a typical iron.

                    Golf Association (USGA), the governing bodies in golf. <br /><br />

                <p>
                The LZR Elite is a performance body suit first manufactured by Speedo in 2008. The suits are made using a combination of elastane-nylon and polyurethane
                which reduce skin drag, compress the body and trap air for buoyancy. All these additional features allows for water to repel and reduce drag when swimming.

                In the 2 year period in which the suits were allowed, 93 swimming world records were broken using the suits. <br /><br />

                At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, 98% of medals in swimming competitions were awarded to swimmers wearing the suit, and 23 out of 25 world records
                broken by swimmers wearing the suit. <br /><br />

                The suits were banned by FINA, the federation recognized by the International Olympic Committee for administering competition of water sport, with the ban
                in effect on January 1, 2010. <br /><br />

                <h2>Running</h2>
                <h3>Nike Vaporfly Series, 2016</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2016, Nike released the Nike Vaporfly 4%. The shoe was designed to give runners a considerable boost by saving energy spent by the runners. The shoes
                    started the major debate of "technological doping" in the world of running. <br /><br />

                    The key to the Vaporfly design is a carbon-fiber plate in the sole that's curved under the front of the shoe. That curvature helps quickly rock
                    a runner from their heels to their toes as they land and push off again. <br /><br />

                    The visualization on the right points out key facts about the shoe. Clicking on the tiles will lead to their respective sources.

                    Despite the controversy surrounding the shoe, the Vaporflys are still legal. <br /><br />

                    The International Olympic Committee ruled that shoes with soles thicker than 40mm
                    or containing more than one carbon-fibre plates are not allowed. The Vaporflys meet these requirements. <br /><br />

                    Do you think the Vaporflys should be banned?
